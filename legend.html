    <i>No Phrase Match</i></font><p>
    
    
    </p><h2><font color="red" face="arial,helvetica"> The red (or purple) bar </font></h2>
    
    The red bar, along with the percentage next to it, is the result's
    PageRank.  (The bar is purple for subsequent results from the same
    website.)  The PageRank is a measure of the "importance" of a page; a
    result has high PageRank if lots of other pages with high PageRank
    point to it.  The PageRank of a page does not depend on the query
    you've entered, but is instead a property of the page itself.<p>
    
    The PageRank is computed automatically; we have no control over the
    PageRank of specific pages.</p><p>
    
    
    </p><h2><font color="red" face="arial,helvetica"> The text after the red bar </font></h2>
    
    Next to the PageRank is the title of the result document.  Sometimes,
    instead of a title there will be a URL.  This means that we have not
    yet indexed the web page we're returning, so we don't know its title.
    We still know it's a good match, though, because of other web pages --
    which we <i>have</i> indexed -- that have links to the returned page.
    If the text associated with these links matches your query, we may
    return the page as a result even though it has not been indexed. <p>
    
    
    </p><h2><font color="red" face="arial,helvetica"> The text below the title </font></h2>
    
    This text is a summary of the result page.  The text returned is not
    necessarily the first text on the page, but instead is an excerpt of
    the page that includes one or more of your query terms. <p>
    
    In order to keep the results a reasonable size, we only show a few
    excerpts from the result page.  We include the text <tt>(xx more)</tt>
    if there are more excerpts containing the query terms. </p><p>
    
    
    </p><h2><font color="red" face="arial,helvetica"> The last line </font></h2>
    
    The last line has several components.  The first one is typically the
    URL of the result page, in green.  If the URL was shown on the first
    line (instead of the title), it is omitted here. <p>
    
    After the URL is a <tt>Cached</tt> link.  If you click on this
    you will see the contents of the web page as of the time we indexed
    it.  For web sites with fast-changing content, such as news sites, the
    current contents of a web page may not be a good match for your query.
    The cached content is the content Google! used to judge this page a
    good match for your query. </p><p>
    
    The cache link will be missing for sites that have not been indexed,
    as well as for sites whose owners have asked us to remove the cached
    content. </p><p>
    
    If you click on the cache link, the resulting page will have some HTTP
    header information at the top.  This is a feature, not a bug!  The
    information may be interesting in itself -- the dates can tell you how
    old the cached content is -- but more importantly it reminds you you
    are looking at a cached version of the page and not the page
    itself. </p><p>
    
    The next number on the line is the size of the web page.  It is
    omitted for sites we have not yet indexed. </p><p>
    
    Finally, for queries with more than one word in them, there will be an
    indication <tt>Phrase Match</tt>, <tt>Partial Phrase Match</tt>, or
    <tt>No Phrase Match</tt> at the end of the line.  A "Phrase Match"
    means all the query words occur next to each other somewhere in the
    document.  A "Partial Phrase Match" means some, but not all, of the
    words can be found next to each other.  "No Phrase Match" means no
    query words are adjacent.</p><p>
